<h1 id="mcetoc_1b2ng2qtb0" style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;">Enemy Pie </span></h1>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i><span style="color: #000000;">by Derek Munson</span><br /><span style="color: #000000;">illustrated by Tara Calahan King</span></i></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">It was a perfect summer until Jeremy Ross moved in right next door to my best friend Stanley.&nbsp;I did not like Jeremy. He had a party and I wasn't even invited. But my best friend Stanley was. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">I never had an enemy until Jeremy moved into the neighborhood. Dad told me that when he was my age, he had enemies, too. But he knew of a way to get rid of them.</span></p>
<div style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em; clear: both;width: 50%;"><span style="color: #000000;"><img src="P16_FW_Appendix_B.jpg" alt="" style="width: 100%;height: auto;" /></span></div>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Dad pulled a worn-out scrap of paper from a recipe book. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">"Enemy Pie," he said, satisfied.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">You may be wondering what exactly is in Enemy Pie. Dad said the recipe was so secret, he couldn't even tell me. I begged him to tell me something&mdash;anything.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">"I will tell you this, Tom," he said to me. "Enemy Pie is the fastest known way to get rid of enemies."</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">This got me thinking. What kinds of disgusting things would I put into Enemy Pie? I brought Dad earthworms and rocks, but he gave them right back.</span></p>
<div style="float: left; margin-right: 1em; clear: both;width: 20%"><span style="color: #000000;"><img src="P16_FW_Appendix_B - 2.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">I went outside to play. All the while, I listened to the sounds of my dad in the kitchen. This could be a great summer after all.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">I tried to imagine how horrible Enemy Pie must smell. But I smelled something really good. As far as I could tell, it was coming from our kitchen. I was confused.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">I went inside to ask Dad what was wrong. Enemy Pie shouldn&rsquo;t smell this good. But Dad was smart. &ldquo;If it smelled bad, your enemy would never eat it,&rdquo; he said. I could tell he&rsquo;d made this pie before.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The oven buzzer rang. Dad put on oven mitts and pulled out the pie. It looked good enough to eat! I was beginning to understand. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">But still, I wasn&rsquo;t sure how this Enemy Pie worked. What exactly did it do to enemies? Maybe it made their hair fall out, or their breath stinky. I asked Dad, but he was no help.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">While the pie cooled, Dad filled me in on my job.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">He whispered. &ldquo;In order for it to work, you need to spend a day with your enemy. Even worse, you have to be nice to him. It&rsquo;s not easy. But that&rsquo;s the only way that Enemy Pie can work. Are you sure you want to do this?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Of course I was.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">All I had to do was spend one day with Jeremy, then he&rsquo;d be out of my life. I rode my bike to his house and knocked on the door.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">When Jeremy opened thedoor, he seemed surprised.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;width: 70%; margin: 1em auto;"><span style="color: #000000;"><img src="P16_FW_Appendix_B - 3.jpg" alt="" width="344" height="352" /></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">&ldquo;Can you come out and play?&rdquo; I asked.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">He looked confused. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go ask my mom,&rdquo; he said. He came back with his shoes in his hand. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">We rode bikes for awhile, then ate lunch. After lunch we went over to my house.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">It was strange, but I was having fun with my enemy. I couldn&rsquo;t tell Dad that, since he had worked so hard to make the pie.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">We played games until my dad called us for dinner.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Dad had made my favorite food. It was Jeremy&rsquo;s favorite, too! Maybe Jeremy wasn&rsquo;t so bad after all. I was beginning to think that maybe we should forget about Enemy Pie.</span></p>
<div style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em; clear: both; width: 50%;"><span style="color: #000000;"><img src="P16_FW_Appendix_B - 4.jpg" alt="" width="256" height="266" /></span></div>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">&ldquo;Dad&rdquo;, I said, &ldquo;It sure is nice having a new friend.&rdquo; I was trying to tell him that Jeremy was no longer my enemy. But Dad only smiled and nodded. I think he thought I was just pretending.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">But after dinner, Dad brought out the pie. He dished up three plates and passed one to me and one to Jeremy.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">&ldquo;Wow!&rdquo; Jeremy said, looking at the pie.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">I panicked. I didn&rsquo;t want Jeremy to eat Enemy Pie! He was my friend!</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t eat it!&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s bad!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Jeremy&rsquo;s fork stopped before reaching his mouth. He looked at me funny. I felt relieved. I had saved his life.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s so bad,&rdquo; Jeremy asked, &ldquo;then why has your dad already eaten half of it?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Sure enough, Dad was eating Enemy Pie.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">&ldquo;Good stuff,&rdquo; Dad mumbled. I sat there watching them eat. Neither one of them was losing any hair! It seemed safe, so I took a tiny taste. It was delicious!</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">After dessert, Jeremy invited me to come over to his house the next morning.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">As for Enemy Pie, I still don&rsquo;t know how to make it. I still wonder if enemies really do hate it or if their hair falls out or their breath turns bad. But I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;ll ever get an answer, because I just lost my best enemy.</span></p>
